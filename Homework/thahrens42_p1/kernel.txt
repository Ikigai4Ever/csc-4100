int main:

	call clear_scr with the start row, start column, end row, and end column
	call the box function with the start row, start column
		end row, and end column of the box
	call print_to with the row and column, and string to print

	note: prototype of the following functions are:
	int box(unsigned int srow, unsigned int scol, unsigned 
		   int erow, unsigned int ecol);
	int print_to(unsinged int row, unsigned int col, char *string);
	int clear_scr(int start_row, int start_col, int width, int height);
	box() and clear_scr returns 1 on error
	The values that you should pass for box and clear_scr are srow = 21, 
	scol = 49, erow = 27, ecol = 79
	The values that you should pass for print_to are row = 24, 
	column= 59, and string = "Hello world"
	
Writing the clear_src() function is simple.  You will use the putc_to() function provided by the professor in the libos.a library.  Therefore, to clear the part of the screen specified by the clear_src() parameters, you can write a nested loop.  The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.  From the inner loop, simply call  putc_to(), and pass it the row, column, and the character space (' ').  The prototype for the putc_to function is as follows:

	void putc_to(unsigned int row, unsigned int col, const char c);
